# Hydrogren-diffusion-in-GaN-
Simulation of hydrogen diffusion in a GaN lattice at different temperatures. Attempts to model different anneals accounting for diffusion based on Ficks Laws (concentration gradient) and the band bending present at the surface of the lattice.

MATLAB script finalwplots will run using ficksnew function
Plots will be produced that describe the evolving Hydrogren concentration with time
